# ELK Stack Logging Files

This is meant to be a simple ELK stack example taking any log files that you put in the log directory (as identified by the .log extension) and dumping them into elastic. Kibana can be used to view the logs, but nothing is setup except for configuration.

## Running

`docker-compose up`

Put any log files in the log directory.
